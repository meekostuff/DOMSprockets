DOMSprockets
============

A Javascript library providing a DOM binding / behavior engine.

Background
----------

This code is derived from the [XBLUI project](http://www.meekostuff.net/projects/XBLUI/) 
which is a (partial) Javascript implementation of the 
[initial XBL 2.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/CR-xbl-20070316/).

XBL2 is no longer recommended and XML is out of favor on the web. 

DOMSprockets will support a Javascript API similar to that envisaged by the [XBL 2.0 working group note](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/NOTE-xbl-20120524/) of 2012.
